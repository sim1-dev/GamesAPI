# GamesAPI

#### An example implementation of a small .NET games library Web API i developed for educational purposes.

It is not intended to be production ready or to be maintained apart from occasional bug fixing; **most of the features provided are not fully implemented, rather included as a demonstration on how they could be structured in a realistic scenario**.

If you want to take a look at the actual development stage, checkout the '**develop**' branch. 

Additional feature branches may be opened occasionally.
